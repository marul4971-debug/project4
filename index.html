The Medical Store Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to 
streamline and automate the operations of medical stores or pharmacies. This system facilitates 
efficient management of inventory, sales, and customer interactions, optimizing the overall 
workflow within a medical retail environment. Key features include inventory tracking, real
time stock management, sales and purchase order processing, and customer management. The 
system enhances accuracy and reduces manual errors, ensuring timely restocking of medicines 
and effective sales management. With an intuitive user interface, it offers an easy-to-use 
platform for medical store personnel. The implementation of this system leads to improved 
operational efficiency, better customer service, and effective decision-making.

            <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <p>This paper presents a Savvy Stock Framework for Expiry Date Follow-Up based on an 
ESP32 microcontroller. The framework organizes different products in different sections of a 
clever rack. One week prior to the product's expiration, the system notifies the owner of its 
shelf location. These alerts are displayed on an LCD screen and sent as notifications. The 
system also monitors inventory levels and issues low-stock alerts to ensure timely restocking. 
To increase product safety, the shelves are equipped with a smoke and moisture sensor. If the 
system detects unusual moisture levels or smoke, it instantly alerts the owner and sounds a 
buzzer alarm to ensure prompt action.</p>
